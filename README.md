# RedFace: A Reddit for your Facebook

### Introduction
This is a very basic Rails project that was meant to serve as a sample app for
using the Facebook API to grab data and represent it in a meaningful way --
specifically, using a Reddit-like ranking algorithm that takes activity and time
into account in an unbiased way.
